# Program to add two 8-bit binary numbers 
# By Juan Carlos Rojas
#
# The operands are read from memory locations:
#   0x00    first_number 
#   0x01    second_number
# The result will be placed in memory at:
#   0x02    result

# Read the first two operands into r0 and r1
ld 0x00 r0
ld 0x01 r1

# Add them into r2
add r0 r1 r2

# Store the result into the desired memory location
st r2 0x02

# All done
halt
