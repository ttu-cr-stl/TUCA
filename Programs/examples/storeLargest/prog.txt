# Program to compare two 8-bit numbers and store the largest
# By Juan Carlos Rojas
#
# The operands are read from memory locations:
#   0x00    first_number 
#   0x01    second_number
# The result will be placed in memory at:
#   0x02    result

# Variables
def src1 0x00
def src2 0x01
def dst 0x02

# Read the first two operands into r0 and r1
ld src1 r0
ld src2 r1

# Compare
gt r0 r1 r2

# If the first number was larger (r2==1), donÂ´t do anything
skipif r2

# If the second number was larger, copy it into r0
ld src2 r0

# Store what is in r0 onto destination
st r0 dst

# All done
halt
